# Overview
This repo includes the assignment projects and my solutions of GANs Specialization Course 
made by deeplearning.ai (Generative Adversarial Networks Specialization). 

The original weekly assignments were distributed using python notebook. Indeed, 
I have to admit that jupyter notebook is really convenient for interactive programming, but...
when the project gets much bigger I find it hard to debug or code refactoring, let alone further code reusing. 
So, if you hold the same feeling, you come to the right place.

Each assignment would be placed in a separate folder and the guidance of each assignment follows the 
original jupyter notebook. Check it out [>>here<<](https://github.com/sahilkhose/Generative-Adversarial-Networks-GANs-Specialization).
